          Hey, My name is Julian and I am kinda sorta a software dev. 
          <br></br>
          Currenly I work in IT fulltime, but on the side I like to think of myself as a freelance software devloper or programmer.
          <br></br>
          My currently favorite Languages to work in include python and c++, but I'd addtionally consider myself compentent in java and go.
          <br></br>
          Around late 2019 - early 2020 I started taking on random jobs online, which mostly included programming bots for social media services like twitter and instagram
          <br></br>
          Since then, that has balloned into a small side buisness and I'm looking to better organize and expand that.
          <br></br>
